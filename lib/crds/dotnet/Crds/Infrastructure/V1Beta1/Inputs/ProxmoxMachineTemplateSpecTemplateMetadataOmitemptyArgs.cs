    /// ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta. 
    ///  ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template` and `MachineSet.Template`, which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies the API and some issues that can impact user experience. 
    ///  During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054) for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs, specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`. The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package. 
    ///  In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta` had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time). The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null` which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable. 
    ///  In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.
