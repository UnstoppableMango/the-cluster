    /// AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be present. 
    ///  Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria: 
    ///  * The most specific match as defined by the Route type. * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04". * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz. 
    ///  All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid, support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest of the rules within that Route should still be supported.
