        :param Sequence['GatewaySpecListenersArgs'] listeners: Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At least one Listener MUST be specified. 
                Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_ apply in that case). 
                Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname. 
                Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their targeted conformance profile: 
                HTTP Profile 
                1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided 
                TLS Profile 
                1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough 
                "Distinct" Listeners have the following property: 
                The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other Listener fields. 
                For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct: 
                1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener with the same Protocol has the same Port value. 
                Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant for HTTP or HTTPS protocols. 
                When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the Listener to be distinct. 
                When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes. 
                Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`. 
                Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`. The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence. 
                The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`. 
                If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted" condition in the Listener Status to "True". 
                Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner. This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at least one Listener must be present. 
                The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.

        Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At least one Listener MUST be specified. 
         Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_ apply in that case). 
         Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname. 
         Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their targeted conformance profile: 
         HTTP Profile 
         1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided 
         TLS Profile 
         1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough 
         "Distinct" Listeners have the following property: 
         The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other Listener fields. 
         For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct: 
         1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values. 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener with the same Protocol has the same Port value. 
         Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant for HTTP or HTTPS protocols. 
         When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the Listener to be distinct. 
         When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes. 
         Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`. 
         Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`. The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence. 
         The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`. 
         If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted" condition in the Listener Status to "True". 
         Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner. This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at least one Listener must be present. 
         The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted. 
         A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if: 
         1. They are distinct. 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned addresses. 
         Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation may not be compatible for another.

        Spec defines the desired state of HTTPRoute.
        :param Sequence[str] hostnames: Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend. 
                Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: 
                1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. 
                If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example: 
                * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`. * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example, `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match. 
                Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. 
                If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match. 
                If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus. 
                In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of: 
                * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. 
                If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for HTTPRouteMatches takes over. 
                Support: Core
        :param Sequence['HTTPRouteSpecParentRefsArgs'] parent_refs: ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route. 
                There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
                * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources. 
                ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that: 
                * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route. * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
                Some examples: 
                * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`. 
                It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.

        Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend. 
         Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: 
         1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. 
         If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example: 
         * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`. * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example, `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match. 
         Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. 
         If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match. 
         If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus. 
         In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of: 
         * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. 
         If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

        ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.

         * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources. 
         ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that: 
         * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route. * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
         Some examples: 
         * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
                * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only) 
                Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference. 
                 ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. 
                ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.  
                Support: Core
        :param int port: Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted differently based on the type of parent resource. 
                When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. 
                 When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.  
                Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if Port is interpreted. 
                For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. * Service: Port Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. Note that attaching Routes to Services as Parents is part of experimental Mesh support and is not supported for any other purpose. 
                Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is interpreted.
