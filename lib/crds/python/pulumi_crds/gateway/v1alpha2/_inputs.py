                There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
                * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only) 
                Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] namespace: Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers to the local namespace of the Route. 
                Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference. 
                 ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. 
                ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.  
                Support: Core
        :param pulumi.Input[int] port: Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted differently based on the type of parent resource. 
                When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. 
                 When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.  
                Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if Port is interpreted. 
                For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway. 
                Support: Extended 
                
        :param pulumi.Input[str] section_name: SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following: 
                * Gateway: Listener Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. * Service: Port Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. Note that attaching Routes to Services as Parents is part of experimental Mesh support and is not supported for any other purpose. 
                Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is interpreted. 
                When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource. For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

        PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an associated Ancestor. 
         Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers have a _very_ good reason otherwise. 
         In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway. 
         Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying implementations. 
         For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway. In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the ancestor object referred to in this status. 
         Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route. 
                There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
                * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources. 
                ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that: 
                * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route. * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
                Some examples: 
                * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`. 
                It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged. 
                Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference. 
                 ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. 
                ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.

If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
         Some examples: 
         * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`. 
         It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged. 
         Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference. 
          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. 
         ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.

When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. 
          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

         This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.

                Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] namespace: Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers to the local namespace of the Route.

Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference. 
                 ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. 
                ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.

It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.

                For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route. 
                There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
                * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources. 
                ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that: 
                * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route. * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
                Some examples: 
                * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`. 
                It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged. 
                Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to.

        ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route. 
         There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support: 
         * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources. 
         ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that: 
         * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route. * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination. 
         Some examples: 
         * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`. * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`. 
         It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged. 
         Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference. 
          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service.
